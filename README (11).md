# Tennis Ball Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict the lifespan of tennis balls based on various features, such as bounce height, bounce speed, material composition, temperature, and humidity. Three models are used: Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.

## Steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Data from various locations like Katy, TX, and Frisco, TX, was collected with details on bounce height, speed, material, and environmental conditions.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Features like bounce height degradation and temperature-material interaction were created.
3. **Model Training**: Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks were trained on the dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: The models were evaluated based on accuracy, MAE, precision, and recall.

## Results

- Random Forest and SVM achieved perfect accuracy.
- Neural Networks also performed well with high precision and recall.

## Visualizations

Bar charts for accuracy, MAE, precision, and recall are included.
